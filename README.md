# Video Object Detection and Cropping

This project uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) to detect objects in a video, crops the detected objects, and saves them to a specified folder. The process is implemented in Google Colab.

## Getting Started
In the code, there is a parameter that changes according to the video duration. I adjusted it to 7 seconds, but if the video duration is 7 minutes, you need to convert it to seconds (7 * 60). The rest of the code remains the same.

### Prerequisites

- Google Colab
- Python 3.x

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krishna-k70/video-object-detection.git
   cd video-object-detection
